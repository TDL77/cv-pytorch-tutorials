# Tutorials on Computer Vision with PyTorch

This repo gives a walkthrough of training and testing image classification and semantic segmentation algorithms. Finally, it shows how to 
create a simple web interface so that anyone can use it!

## Setup

Create a fresh conda environment. 

```bash
# clone
git clone reponame
cd reponame
# create fresh conda environment
conda create -n cvp python=3.8
conda activate cvp
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install gradio
```

## How to run?

You can simply run the notebooks in order. See releases for the datasets.
